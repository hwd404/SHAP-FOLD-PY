# SHAP-FOLD-PY
A Python implementation of SHAP-FOLD algorithms
The author of SHAP-FOLD also has an original implementation: https://github.com/fxs130430/SHAP_FOLD \
You can find the research paper and description in this repository. \
A novel contribution in this Python implementation is that the High Utility Itemset Mining has been built with Beam search and some optimization, which provides a decent performance for HUIM. \
